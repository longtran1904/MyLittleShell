## Makefile Intructions
- 'make' (default) will run debug mode
- 'make run' will run on official mode

## Our Shell Extensions:
### Multiple pipes
  - Our shell allows user to use as many piping commands as they wish

### HOME directory
  - Allow user to traverse to HOME directory using `~`

## Testing Plan:
*** Notice ***
  - Testcases are created based on iLab machine's file system. 
  - Please use iLab machines to test these cases for accurate result

### Unit testing - Single commands:
  - Built-in Programs:
    - pwd: 
      - Single command: output into current STDOUT_FILENO (redirection will set STDOUT_FILENO before executing)
      - Pipeline command: output into pipeline
    - cd: Do not have input/output

  - Exectuting Programs:
    - Assure to be able to run programs in these directories:
      1. /usr/local/sbin 
        - `/usr/local/sbin/showstats.sh`
      2. /usr/local/bin
        - `/usr/local/bin/eclipse`
      3. /usr/sbin
        - `/usr/sbin/zic`
      4. /usr/bin
        - `/usr/bin/ls`
      5. /sbin
        - `/sbin/zic` 
      6. /bin
        - `/bin/pwd` 

  - Program with arguments: (argument test for built-in cd)
    - Being able to recognize the argument list for the progam 
        ### One Arguments
        1. `cd ..`
        2. `echo hello` 
        
        ### Two Arguments
        3. `cd .. hello world` -> ERROR
        4. `echo hello world`
        5. `cat filename1 filename2`

        ### Infinite Arguments
        6. `echo hello world this is a very very long sentence and it aims to have infinite length`

	    - Being able to identify argument list for each command in pipeline.
	        7. `echo shell should recognize this sentence as argument list | wc`
	        8. `ls -l | grep "file"` -> expected SUCCESS: -l is argument of ls, "file" is argument of grep
	
	  - Redirections: 
		    - Redirection token is recognized without space
		      -  `echo hello world>echo.txt`
		      -  `wc<filename1`
		      -  `wc<filename1>wc.txt`
		        -> Expected wc counts words in filename1 and write to wc.txt
		    - Redirection token and its input/output token can be placed anywhere in command line.
		      - `echo hello this is a > echo.txt sentence from echo.`
		      - `echo > echo.txt this is a sentence.`
		      - `echo this is a sentence > echo.txt`
	
	      
	  - Pipes (Multiple pipes):
		      - Pipes still work even though second command doesn't use input from first command
	         - `echo hello world | ls`
	      - Pipes still work even though first command write nothing, and second command use input from pipe
	         - `cd .. | wc`  
	
	      - Two Pipes
	         - `ls -l | grep "file" | wc`
	         - `ls -l | grep "e" | awk '{print $9}' | wc`
     - Home Directory
    	 - the user can include `~/` at anypoint in their commands and it will be replaced with their home directory
		     -  ` ~/command1 < input | command2 > output`
		     -  ` command1 < ~/input | ~/command2 > output`
     -  Wildcards
    	 -  the user can include wildcards anywhere in a command (even if the token is a path, in which case, the token will be replaced by everything matching the wildcard in said path)
     			-  ` command1 < foo*bar star | ~/command2 > output`
     			-  ` command1 < command2 jar |  car foo*bar > output`
 			-  wildcards can be combined with home dir symbol `~/`
 				-  ` ~/command1 < foo*bar star | ~/command2 > output`

  - Errors Detected:
      * lone redirections and lone pipes
      1. `>`
      2. `|`
      * no token after redirection or after / before pipe
      1. `echo >` 
      2. `echo <`
      3. `echo |`
      4. `| echo`
      * adjacent pipe and redirection tokens
      1. `echo <<`
      2. `echo >>`
      3. `echo >|`
      4. `echo |<`

      * Multiple redirections: uses last one found
      1. `echo >echo1.txt >echo2.txt` uses >echo2.txt
      2. `wc <filename1 <filename2` uses <filename2
      3. `wc <filename1 >wc.txt <filename2`
      4. `wc <filename1 >wc.txt >wc2.txt`
